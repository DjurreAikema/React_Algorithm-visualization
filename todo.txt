Sytling:
    better colors
    Nice buttons
    better grid spacing

Functionality:
    add tabs for different algorithms using react router
    Scare grid to screen size
    Add more algorithims:
        -dijkstra
        -maze generate algorithm
        -sorting algorithms
    Make it so mouse down only changes it to the first selected value, so if you place down walls it doesnt remove walls when you go over them. And when you remove walls it doesnt place them

Bugs:
    Clearing the grid create visual dsync
    Holding the mouse down doest smoothly add walls
